            <p class="m-1">Visit our <a href="/list/">Repository</a> and use the search bar to narrow your search.
            Keywords should be separated by white spaces and can mix words from different fields
            (e.g. 'machine learning London' or 'neuron computational modeling'). You can filter
            results to display only profiles from under-represented countries (list based on the
            <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups">World's Bank</a>
            list of Low, Lower-Middle and Upper-Middle income economies as of August 2017).</p>

            <p class="m-1">Look at the profile provided by the researcher and
            Google them for other profiles (e.g. LinkedIn, institution, ResearchGate, â€¦).
            Read the recommendations if any, making sure they are sound (e.g. if Recommender A says 'great talk at OHBM 2017',
            check the OHBM 2017 program and maybe watch the video if available). Important note: the
            researchers are sole responsible for their profiles and we cannot guarantee authenticity.</p>

            <p class="m-1">It is a vicious circle: researchers need to be known to get
            invited as speakers but they need to be invited as speaker to get known. This cycle
            can be broken by taking a chance and inviting someone less recognized. Don't forget that younger scientists
            also have things to say and they might be more approachable/committed.</p>

            (as videos of the event might be available). Also include any potential conflicts of interest, disclosing any personal relationship with the scientist (e.g. colleague, close friend, student, ...). At the
            moment, it is NOT possible to edit a recommendation, but <a href="mailto:admin@winrepo.org">contact us</a> for related queries.</p>
